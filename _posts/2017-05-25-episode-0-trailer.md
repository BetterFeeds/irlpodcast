    Hi boys. I'm Tina. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I'm gonna write the most erotic, graphic, freakiest friend fiction ever. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. How do you know a python ate it? Did it leave a note? Not if you're a fish. I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the Earth. Is it possible to be in love with 25 people at once? Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. I'm compiling a list of people I can mate with to repopulate the Earth. The hand wants what the hand wants. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. The hand wants what the hand wants.

    There's someone behind the milk. Maybe it's the dairy fairy. If I drunk text you and you're asleep, don't text me in the morningâ€¦that ship has sailed. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first? My bra's chafing me. Let's raise our glasses! I need both ears to hold up my glasses. Buns...sen. Detention is no big deal. Don't have a crap attack. Your body. Hey, you don't want to mess with my sister. She'll wear down your self esteem over a period of years. Sometimes with Jimmy Jr, I don't know what to say. But now I don't know what not to say and it's like okay guys, who can get to my mouth first? The hand wants what the hand wants. Dad, if you believe you're beautiful, you will be. I did.

    The second time hurt the most. Give them ridiculous French accents. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I need both ears to hold up my glasses. Ok then, see you on our date! I need both ears to hold up my glasses. Your body. This is where I thrash. Your body. This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with dental benefits. I could go to jail, or hell, or jail-hell. The hand wants what the hand wants. Drop the towel.
